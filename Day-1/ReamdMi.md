# What is Node js.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript on the server, allowing developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications.
# What is V8 Engine.
The V8 engine is an open-source, high-performance JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for the Google Chrome web browser. It is written in C++ and is designed to execute JavaScript code quickly and efficiently.
# What is Variable in JavaScript.
 Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. You can think of a variable as a container that holds a value, and this value can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, objects, or functions.
 You can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keyword.
 var: Historically used for variable declaration, but it has some scoping issues. It is less commonly used now, and let and const are often preferred.
 var a = 15;
 let: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 let allows you to declare block-scoped variables. It is generally preferred over var for its more predictable scoping behavior.
 let b = "Welcome to the PW Skill";
 const: const is used to declare constants. Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned.
 const PI = 3.14;
# Comment in JavaScript
1. Use a single line comment  //
2. Use multi line comment /*   */  
# Typeof in JavaScript 
console.log(typeof null); // Object
console.log(typeof NaN); // number
console.log(typeof Boolean); // Function
console.log(typeof Object); // Function
console.log(typeof Array); // Function
console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
console.log(typeof BigInt); // Function
console.log(typeof -1); // number
console.log(typeof true); // boolean
console.log(typeof (true + true)); // number because true = 1 so 1+1 = 2 this is a number
